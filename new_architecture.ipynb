## Architecture Since RL turned out badly (Even Waymo doesn't use it):

# Vision: YOLOv12 (detect objects/threats)
threats = yolo_v12(image)  # "pedestrian crossing", "car braking"

# Small VLM: Qwen 0.6B (generate natural warnings)
warning = qwen_vlm(threats, context)
# "Car ahead braking hard - slow down!"
# "Pedestrian at crosswalk - prepare to stop"

# Cache: Store scene → warning mappings
if scene_hash in cache:
    return cache[scene_hash]  # Instant warning!

# ONLINE LEARNING CYCLE:

1. Drive Session (Real-time):
   - YOLOv12 detects threats
   - Check cache first (instant warnings!)
   - If miss: Qwen 0.6B generates warning
   - Store in cache + log for training

2. After Session (Offline):
   - Fine-tune Qwen on session data
   - "Car braking hard" → "Brake now!" (good)
   - "Slow car ahead" → "COLLISION!" (bad, adjust)
   - Update model weights
   - Next session uses better model!

3. Cache Updates:
   - Successful warnings → strengthen cache
   - False alarms → remove from cache
   - New threats → add to cache
```

# **Novel Contribution:**

**"Session-Based Fine-Tuning with Cached Inference for Real-Time Threat Detection"**

✅ **Real-time:** Cache + small VLM (instant warnings)  
✅ **Learns:** Fine-tune after each session (gets smarter)  
✅ **Practical:** No agent loops during driving  
✅ **Scalable:** Each driver's sessions improve their model  

## **The Workflow:**
```
SESSION 1 (Day 1):
└─> Drive with base Qwen 0.6B
└─> Log: 50 threats detected, 45 good warnings, 5 false alarms
└─> Fine-tune overnight on those 50 examples

SESSION 2 (Day 2):
└─> Drive with improved model
└─> Better warnings! 48/50 good
└─> Fine-tune again...

...model keeps improving!
