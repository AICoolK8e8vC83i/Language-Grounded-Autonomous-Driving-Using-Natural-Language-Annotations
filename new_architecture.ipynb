## Architecture Since RL turned out badly (Even Waymo doesn't use it):

# Vision: YOLOv12 (detect objects/threats)
threats = yolo_v12(image)  # "pedestrian crossing", "car braking"

# Small VLM: Qwen 0.6B (generate natural warnings)
warning = qwen_vlm(threats, context)
# "Car ahead braking hard - slow down!"
# "Pedestrian at crosswalk - prepare to stop"

# Cache: Store scene â†’ warning mappings
if scene_hash in cache:
    return cache[scene_hash]  # Instant warning!
